Programming for Data Analytics - Project 1 repository

This repository contains the data (csv file) and jupyter notebook relating to my Programming for Data Analytics (PfDA) project 1.

## Problem Statement ##

For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of
your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is
of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data
related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.
We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.
Specifically, in this project you should:
 - Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could
collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
 - Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their
relationships with each other.
 - Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
 - Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the
data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.
Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set. Some
students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files. It is okay to
base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do),
but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set. The next section
gives an example project idea.

### How to view the project ###

The project is presented in a jupyter notebook using Python 3. During the development of the project I updated the Anaconda package on my local machine which required some amendment to the code. The final version of the project does operate with the most recent version of the ANaconda package with some future warnings with deprecated features which will be removed in future versions. 

### Project Approach ###

The approach adopted for the project was to identify and source a dataset appropriate for the analysis, for this I selected a Kaggle dataset detailing tweet engagement rates. A description of the dataset included on kaggle details the dataset:

*The dataset consists of 21677 tweets posted from 25th March 2019 to 31st January 2022 by 23 Destination marketing organizations (DMO). The tweets were collected to study the social media content strategy of DMOs. Specifically, the research attempted to study how the linguistic features in social media content strategies of DMOs change during the pre-Covid, lockdown, and post-lockdown phases and their impact on social media user engagement. Accordingly, the data constitutes key variables like confidence and positive engagement expressed in a tweet, the amount of cognitive content embedded in a tweet, the media type, the number of hashtags, mentions, and word count of a tweet. The number of likes and retweets associated with each tweet is also captured. The dataset also captures each tweet's date and time stamp to classify it into three phases: pre-COVID, during lockdown, and post-COVID. The timelines are chosen per the Government of India's declaration of the lockdown.*
